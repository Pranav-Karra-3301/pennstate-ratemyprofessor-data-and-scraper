## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts to scrape professor data from RateMyProfessors.com specifically for Penn State University (School ID: 758). The scraper collects professor ratings, departments, difficulty levels, and other available metrics.

**Students gotta do what they gotta do** - but please use this responsibly and ethically!

## Inspiration and Attribution

This project is improved and scoped specifically for Penn State University, inspired by the original [RateMyProfessor.com-Web-Scraper](https://github.com/highlyavailable/RateMyProfessor.com-Web-Scraper) repository. Our implementation focuses on Penn State data with enhanced features and better organization.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Scrapes all professor data from Penn State University (~7,703 professors)
- ‚úÖ Extracts ratings, number of reviews, "would take again" percentages, and difficulty levels
- ‚úÖ Outputs data in JSON Lines (.jsonl) format for easy processing
- ‚úÖ Test mode for safe experimentation with small data batches
- ‚úÖ Automated data updates via GitHub Actions (every 4 months)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Individual review scraping (requires browser installation - coming soon)

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd pennstate-ratemyprofessor-data-and-scraper
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage Examples

**Test Mode (Recommended for first run):**
```bash
python -m scraper.main_scraper --test
```
*Scrapes only 10 professors for testing*

**Scrape First 100 Professors:**
```bash
python -m scraper.main_scraper --max-professors 100
```

**Professors Only (No Reviews):**
```bash
python -m scraper.main_scraper --skip-reviews
```

**Full Scrape (WARNING: Takes hours!):**
```bash
python -m scraper.main_scraper --full
```
*‚ö†Ô∏è This will attempt to scrape all ~7,700 professors and may take 10+ hours*

## Output Files

All scraped data is stored in the `data/` directory:

- `data/penn_state_professors.jsonl` - Professor information (ratings, departments, etc.)
- `data/penn_state_reviews.jsonl` - Individual student reviews (requires browser setup)
- `data/penn_state_courses.jsonl` - Course-specific data extracted from reviews

### Sample Data Format

```json
{
  "name": "Jeff Love",
  "department": "Psychology", 
  "school": "Penn State University",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "num_ratings": 284,
  "would_take_again_pct": 90.625,
  "level_of_difficulty": 2.6,
  "url": null,
  "professor_id": null
}
```

## Automated Updates

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically updates the professor data every 4 months:

- **August 1st** - Fall semester update
- **January 1st** - Spring semester update  
- **May 1st** - Summer semester update

This ensures the data stays current across academic terms.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Simple Scraper** (`scraper/simple_scraper.py`) - Uses requests + BeautifulSoup (no browser required)
- **Models** (`scraper/models.py`) - Data structures for professors, reviews, and courses
- **Configuration** (`scraper/config.py`) - All settings and Penn State specific parameters

### Penn State Specific Settings

- School ID: 758
- Base URL: `https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/search/professors/758?q=*`
- Total Professors: ~7,703 (as of last update)

### Rate Limiting

The scraper includes built-in rate limiting and retry logic to be respectful to RateMyProfessors.com servers:

- 1 second delay between requests
- Exponential backoff on failures
- Maximum 3 retry attempts

## Limitations

1. **Review Scraping**: Individual professor reviews require a web browser (Chrome/Firefox) installation for JavaScript execution
2. **Pagination**: Currently extracts data from the initial page load (~5 professors at a time)
3. **Rate Limits**: RateMyProfessors may implement rate limiting or blocking
4. **Legal Restrictions**: Usage may violate Terms of Service

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Pagination support for full professor list
- [ ] Browser-free review scraping
- [ ] Course schedule integration
- [ ] Grade distribution correlation
- [ ] Advanced analytics and visualizations

```bash
# Use test mode and be patient:
python -m scraper.main_scraper --test
```

**3. Empty results:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Penn State school ID (758) is still valid
- Run in test mode first

1. Check the log files (created during each run)
2. Try test mode first
3. Review the troubleshooting section above
4. Open an issue if problems persist
